      "content": "**Overview:** Wastewater reuse is widely practiced globally, particularly in agriculture, with significant scale in developing regions where untreated wastewater irrigation far exceeds treated wastewater use, highlighting both opportunities and health risks.\n\n**Key Points:**\n• Approximately 35 million hectares in the global South are irrigated using raw or diluted wastewater, primarily untreated or partially[Source 1].\n\n• Treated wastewater reuse occurs at a scale thirty times smaller than untreated wastewater irrigation in many developing regions [Source 1].\n\n• The Middle East and North Africa region has documented cases of successful water reuse, including urban landscaping and golf course irrigation in Morocco and Tunisia [Source 4].\n\n• Guidelines and best management practices exist to improve the acceptance and safety of agricultural water reuse, addressing technical and governance challenges [Source 5].\n\n**Implications:**\n• Untreated wastewater reuse poses public health risks but supports urban agriculture where treatment is lacking.\n\n• Scaling up treated wastewater reuse requires investment in infrastructure and harmonized governance frameworks.\n\n• Successful cases in arid regions demonstrate wastewater's potential to alleviate water scarcity.\n\n| **Practice** | **Scale/Region** | **Key Feature** |\n|--------------|------------------|-----------------|\n| Untreated wastewater irrigation | ~35 million hectares (Global South) | Predominantly informal, health risks [Source 1] |\n| Treated wastewater reuse | Smaller scale (e.g., MENA) | Formal projects, urban landscaping [Source 4] |\n\nWould you like to explore specific wastewater reuse guidelines or regional case studies in more detail?",

          "content": "Reuse of raw or diluted wastewater for irrigation of ﬁeld crops is practiced around most cities of the global South on a total area of up to 35 million hectares (Raschid-Sally and Jayakody, 2008; Thebo et al., 2017). Most of this irrigation is using untreated or at best partially treated wastewater, at a thirty times larger scale than the known areas using treated wastewater (Scott et al., 2010); Thebo et al., 2017.",
